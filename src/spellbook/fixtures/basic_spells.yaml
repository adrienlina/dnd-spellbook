      The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature
      that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.  The target can move
      only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such
      as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can
      change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn.
      If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise,
      you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's
      range.  When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still
      aloft.
